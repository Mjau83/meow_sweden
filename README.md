![Responsive Image](assets/images/responsive-image.png)


## Project Goals
**What is it?** 
Meow Sweden is a webshop that provides handmade fancy and luxurious cat ears for all crazy catladies with a sence of fashion. Here can the cat fashionista be sure to find sparkely cat ears in different colors and styles. There is also a jewelry section with necklaces made with ancient Quipu code.

**Who is it for?**
For any catlover, male or female (yes, men can be catladies too), that like to level up their outfit.

**Why am I building it?**
This project is actually why I got into coding. I started up Meow Sweden in spring 2019 and started selling my cat ears and necklaces on **[Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/se-en/shop/MeowSweden?ref=seller-platform-mcnav)**. But I always felt like Meow Sweden should have its own homepage with it own webshop. And with this project I can finaly dive into how I would like it to be! And I can get full controll over all the design and all the functionallity.
