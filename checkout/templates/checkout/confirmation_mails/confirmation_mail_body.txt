*** Some IMPORTAT stuff to think about ***

* Payment must be made in full before I begin to make your order if the order is a personalized item. 
Once payment is confirmed, it will generally take between 1-2 weeks if it's a personalized order.
For all cancellations I will need to be notified WITHIN 48hrs of the item being purchased and before shipment, 
or the order will be binding upon the customer.

* Additional charges are the responsibility of the recipient because I have no control over these government-imposed 
charges and cannot determine what they may be. Customs policies vary greatly among countries. 
Please contact your local customs office for information.

* Delivery time may vary, but will approximately take (longer for custom orders) :
~ 3-5 business days within Sweden (FREE shipping)
~ 7-10 business days to European countries  (â‚¬10 will be added for shipping)
~1-2 weeks to North America

---------------------------------------

I hope that you will be happy with your item and that it will bring you lots of cattitude 
and joy. 
Please let me know if there's any issues or if you have any questions about your order, 
and I will try my best to help you. 
Feel free to contact me at {{ contact_email }}.

Thank you again for being a paw-some person.
Have a purr-fect day!
